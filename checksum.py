def calculateChksum(cmd):
    '''
    Return the checksum value in ASCII coded hexadecimal

    Parameters
    ----------
    cmd : str
        String part of the command (e.g. Q051)

    Returns
    -------
    checksum : bytes
        Checksum value in bytes in the form b'XX'

    '''
    arr = bytearray(cmd, 'ascii')
    checksum = bytes(hex(sum(arr) % 256), 'ascii')   # in form  b'0x21'

    return checksum.lstrip(b'0x').zfill(2).upper()


def checkChecksum(mesToCheck):
    '''
    Compare the checksum value recieved to the calculated one

    Extract the checksum value from the incoming message and compare it
    to the checksum calculated from the rest of the message

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesToCheck : bytes
        message from HV stripped from b'\\\\r', in bytes()

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the received and the calculated checksum do not match
    '''

    csumRed = mesToCheck[-2:]
    csumCalc = calculateChksum(mesToCheck[1:-2].decode())

    try:
        assert csumRed == csumCalc
    except AssertionError:
        print('WARNING : Checksum error in the incoming message !')
        # raise ??
